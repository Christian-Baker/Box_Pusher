# Box_Pusher
A puzzle game I made in my Agile Game Development course with C# using Unity and Visual Studio.
It incorporates a player character which pushes boxes into specific locations to complete levels.
As you progress through the game new features get added such as boxes that do different things or
multiple player characters that are controlled at the same time by the user to make the game more 
challenging to complete.
